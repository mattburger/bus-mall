As a user, I want to have an app that will present me with products and allow me to vote which one I like and show me the top recommended products based off my choices.

As a marketing team, we want an app that will present the user any random trio our products and vote on the most desired of the three. We also do not want duplicate display of products, nor back to back viewing of products so that bias is limited towards any one product.

As a developer, I want to create an app that will accept user input and display a clean and readable graph of the user's choices.
